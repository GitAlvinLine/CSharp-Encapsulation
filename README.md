This is an example of Encapsulation. Which is pretty much you create a class and hide data members of fields in that class
so that no other classes can have access to it and manipulate it in any way. You can however see the value of a private field
by creating properties and using the "get" property to see the value outside of the class.
Or you can put that private field in a void method to display it on console.
